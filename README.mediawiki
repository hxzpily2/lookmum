=Lookmum component framework=

ActionScript 3 component framework based on MovieClip composition over inheritance.

==Basic usage==
Components can either wrap movieclips attached from the library, or movieclips that are already in the display list.

This prevents having to state what component a particular library item is.

The following example demonstrates a base component being created with a library clip, then with a clip already on the stage, then a different subclass of component being created, that uses the same library symbol.
{{{
package  
{
	import com.lookmum.view.Component;
	import com.lookmum.view.Button;
	import flash.display.Sprite;
	public class ExampleComponent extends Sprite
	{
		public function ExampleComponent() 
		{
			var libraryComponent:Component = new Component(new libraryClip());
			addChild(libraryComponent);
			
			var stageComponent:Component = new Component(this.stageComponentClip);

			var button:Button = new Button(new libraryClip());
			addChild(button);
		}	
	}
}
}}}
